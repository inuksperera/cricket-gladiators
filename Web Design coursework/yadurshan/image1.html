        Experts agree that cricket was invented during the Saxon or Norman periods by children living in the Weald, a region of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England. 
        In 1611, the first time that cricket was mentioned as an adult sport, a dictionary also referred to the game as a boy's game. There is also the theory that cricket may have evolved from bowls as a result of a batsman's attempt to deflect the ball away from its intended aim.<br><br>
        By the middle of the 17th century, village cricket had advanced, and in the second half of the century, the first English "county teams" were established, with "local specialists" from village cricket serving as the sport's first professionals. 
        1709 is the first game in which sides are recorded using county names.<br><br>
        Cricket became a popular sport in London and the south-eastern regions of England in the first part of the 18th century. Travel restrictions prevented it from becoming widely popular outside of England, but Women's Cricket has been around since 1745, when the first game was played in Surrey.
        <br><br>
        The first Laws of Cricket were published in 1744 and were later changed in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, a third stump, a middle stump, and a maximum bat width were included. The "Star and Garter Club," whose members went on to create the renowned Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787, developed the codes.
        MCC was immediately appointed as the guardian of the Laws, and changes have been made ever since to the present day.<br><br>
        About 1760, when bowlers started pitching the ball, rolling the ball down the ground became obsolete. In response, the straight bat replaced the previous "hockey-stick" style of bat. Up until the founding of MCC and the inauguration of Lord's Cricket Field in 1787, the game was centered on the Hampshire-based Hambledon Club.
        <br><br>
        Cricket was first introduced to North America through the English colonies in the 17th century, and it spread to other areas of the world in the 18th century. Colonialists brought it to the West Indies, and British East India Company sailors brought it to India. In the early years of the 19th century, the sport reached New Zealand 
        and South Africa before making its way to Australia practically as soon as colonization got underway in 1788.
