                <p>In cricket there are many legends who have made an impact and left a lasting legacy in cricket. We will look into some of these legends and their achievements.</p>

                    <h1>Brian Lara</h1>
                    <p>Born in 2nd of May in 1969, Brian Charles Lara is a Trinidadian cricketer. He, along with many others, is considered as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.</p>
                    <div id="brianlara" class="image"></div>
                    <p>He has held many cricket records such as having the highest individual score in first class cricket with 501 not out against Durham in 1994 as well as holding the highest individual score in Test after scoring 400 not out at Antingua in 2004 agaist England for the 4th test.</p>
                    <p>He is considered to have second-best batting performance, by Wisden (The Bible of Cricket), with 153 not out against Australia in 1999 and is only comparable to 270 runs that was scored by Sir Donald Bradman.</p>

                    <h1>Donald Bradman</h1>
                    <div id="donbradman"></div> 
                    <p>Born in 27th of August in 1908, Sir Donald George Bradman is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen.</p>
                    <p>His greatest achievement is reaching an test batting average of 99.94 as claimed by Brett Hutchins.</p>
                    <p>He is also part of Australian folklore involving a young Bradman practising alone. Bradman was so consistent with his high scores that the England team had to make a set of tactics called Bodyline (Fast leg theory bowling) to restrain him specifically.</p>
                    <p>He has appeared on postage stamps and coins with a museum dedicated to him.</p>
